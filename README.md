# Project 1: Gazebo Environment Creation

## 📍 Overview

This project involves creating a custom simulation environment using **Gazebo**, an open-source robotics simulator. The environment is designed to serve as a foundational setup for future robotics tasks such as navigation, mapping, and multi-robot coordination.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **Gazebo (Fortress / Garden / Classic)** – 3D robotics simulator  
- **ROS (optional)** – If integrated with robot control  
- **SDF/URDF** – For defining robot/environment models  
- **Custom World File** – Designed using `.world` and `.model` files  
- **RViz (optional)** – For visualization if ROS is used
